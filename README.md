## Please fill in your project documentation in this README.md file 
openPUF - This design contains contains a bistable ring PUF fabricated in 130-nm through Skywater's 130-nm open source pdk. The design features 3 challenge lengths: 32, 64, and 128-bit with 4 instantiations for measurement of on-chip variation.
The digital flow was used to route challenge bits from a shift register to all of the PUFs.
